Introductory Tutorial
======================

This tutorial will illustrate the basics of how to use :code:`toqito`. This will
cover how to instantiate and use the fundamental objects that :code:`toqito`
provides; namely quantum states, channels, and measurements.

This is a user guide for :code:`toqito` and is not meant to serve as an
introduction to quantum information. For introductory material on quantum
information, please consult "Quantum Information and Quantum Computation" by
Nielsen and Chuang or the freely available lecture notes
`"Introduction to Quantum Computing" <https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~watrous/LectureNotes/CPSC519.Winter2006/all.pdf)>`_
by John Watrous.

More advanced tutorials can be found on the
`tutorials page <https://toqito.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html>`_.

This tutorial assumes you have :code:`toqito` installed on your machine. If you
do not, please consult the
`installation instructions <https://toqito.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_.

States
------

In Quantum Information Theory, *quantum states*  are thought of as matrices that contain information about a set of probabilities. These matrices, called *density operators* have special properties
